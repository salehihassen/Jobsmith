# Getting started with Jobsmith on the desktop

This page walks through a first run end to end: install, setup wizard, first
fetch, scoring and shortlisting, tailoring, the browser extension, Apply Assist,
and marking a job applied. It assumes nothing is configured yet.

If you would rather run Jobsmith from source or in Docker, see
[README.md](https://github.com/TheDevRo/Jobsmith#setup). For how the desktop
build is put together, see
[README-DESKTOP.md](https://github.com/TheDevRo/Jobsmith/blob/main/README-DESKTOP.md).

## 1. Install

Grab the [latest release](https://github.com/TheDevRo/Jobsmith/releases/latest).

- **macOS (Apple Silicon)** — download `Jobsmith_<version>_aarch64.dmg`, open it,
  and drag Jobsmith to Applications.
- **Windows, Linux, Intel macOS** — there is no installer yet; use Docker
  (`docker compose up -d`) and open <http://localhost:8888>. The rest of this
  page applies unchanged.

**Gatekeeper.** The macOS app is unsigned, so the first launch is blocked. Open
**System Settings → Privacy & Security** and click **Open Anyway**, or run:

```bash
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Jobsmith.app
```

## 2. First launch

The first launch downloads Playwright's Chromium (~150 MB) into the app's data
directory, so it takes a few minutes. This is normal and happens once. Jobsmith
needs that browser to scrape job boards.

Then the **setup wizard** opens. Five steps:

1. **AI** — *How should Jobsmith think?* Pick one of three cards (details
   below): **Local**, **Cloud** or **Advanced**. **Continue** runs a real
   one-word test against the model you chose and saves the AI settings only if
   it answers, so the next step can already use it. If the test fails you get
   the reason in plain English (a rejected key, a model your account can't
   use, no credit, rate limiting, or a server that can't be reached) with
   **Show details** for the raw error, plus **Continue anyway** (saves, marked
   unverified) and **Set up AI later** (saves nothing).
2. **Résumé** — upload or paste your existing resume. The AI parses it into
   structured fields. The step says where the résumé goes: it stays on this Mac
   with Local, or is sent to your provider with Cloud.
3. **Profile** — check what was parsed and fill in the rest (contact details,
   work authorization, salary target). This is the only data the AI is allowed
   to use; it never invents facts about you.
4. **Job Search** — keywords, locations, and a salary floor.
5. **Sources** — nothing to set up. The step lists the sources that already
   work, then (if AI is connected) suggests companies to follow from your
   profile and keywords, each checked against a live job board. They come in
   ticked; untick any you don't want. Sources that need a free API key
   (Adzuna, USAJobs) sit in a collapsed section with sign-up links and a
   **Test** button. Finish saves and goes.

There is no config file to edit. `config.yaml` is created on first boot and the
wizard writes every answer into it.

### The three AI cards

- **Local** — Apple Intelligence runs every task on this Mac: free, private,
  nothing to set up. Writing quality is basic; you can connect a cloud provider
  later for stronger résumés. Needs macOS 26+ on Apple Silicon with Apple
  Intelligence turned on; otherwise the card is greyed out with the reason and a
  **Check again** button. A pre-checked, recommended box also downloads
  **Quick match** and **Local match** (the size is shown next to it) for faster
  job scoring and smarter Apply Assist. They download in the background after
  you continue; a chip in the top bar and **Settings → AI** show the progress,
  and Apple Intelligence scores jobs until Quick match is ready.
- **Cloud** — an AI provider you pay for (or a free tier): OpenAI, Anthropic,
  Google Gemini, xAI, Mistral, Groq, DeepSeek, Together AI, Fireworks, Cerebras,
  NVIDIA NIM or OpenRouter. Pick the provider, paste your API key (**Get an API
  key** opens the provider's key page), then search the provider's live model
  list and pick one **Writing model**; Jobsmith ships no default model names.
  Scoring and quick helper tasks use the same model unless you open **Use
  different models for scoring**. **Custom** takes any OpenAI-compatible server,
  including one you run yourself (LM Studio, Ollama, vLLM, llama.cpp, LiteLLM);
  its API key is optional. If a server can't list its models you can type the
  model ID instead.
- **Advanced** — the full form: any server, a different model per tier (with
  Apple Intelligence as a per-tier option), the job-scoring choice and the
  Local match switch, with the provider list as a shortcut for the address.

You can change this any time with **Settings → AI → Change setup…**, which
reopens just this step and returns to Settings when done.

**Skipping and re-running.** Every step can be skipped, and you can close the
wizard entirely — the app works, it just has less to go on. Re-run it any time
from **Settings → App → Re-run setup wizard**. A re-run adds a **Review** step that
shows a diff of what would change before anything is saved (including the AI
step), so it is safe to run again on a configured install.

If your AI server is not reachable, the dashboard shows a warning banner with
an **Open AI Settings** and a **Retry** button. Scoring, tailoring, and resume
parsing do not work until that clears; everything else does.

### Apple Intelligence per tier

In **Settings → AI**, each tier has its own *Use Apple Intelligence
(on-device)* checkbox, shown only on a machine that can run it. The built-in
model is small: fine for scoring and short tasks, weaker at long documents, and
very long job postings can exceed its context window and be skipped. Long
résumés are read in parts so they fit. If Apple Intelligence is later turned off
in System Settings, on-device tiers fail with that reason rather than silently
sending the work to your server.

### Quick match and Local match

- **Quick match** (about 134 MB) scores every job on this computer in a fraction
  of a second, from how well your profile covers each requirement line. Pick it
  under **Settings → AI → Job scoring: Quick match (on-device, free)**; it
  downloads when you save. Jobs it can't judge go to your AI model. Deleting it
  switches job scoring back to your AI model.
- **Local match** (about 690 MB, on-device, beta) is one switch in **Settings →
  AI**. With it on:
  - **Apply Assist** fills the fields left after your profile and answer bank
    *without an LLM*: it only ever picks a form option, types a value copied
    from your profile, or computes years from your role dates. Essay questions
    still go to your AI and come back as drafts to review; anything it isn't
    sure of is left blank for you.
  - **Job-fit scoring** falls back to it when your AI server is unreachable.
    Those scores say *Scored by Local match* and use a different method (the
    share of the posting's requirement lines your profile meets), so they don't
    line up exactly with LLM scores.

  Off (the default) changes nothing. The switch is per machine and never syncs.
  A failed or partial download always offers **Retry** and **Delete**.

## 3. First fetch

The sources that need no setup are **on by default**, so there is nothing to configure. Click
**Fetch Jobs** in the Inbox toolbar, or **Fetch & Score** in the Activity run
console — that one button fetches and then scores everything it found. (The
individual **Fetch** and **Score** buttons are right next to it if you want the
steps separately.)

These sources work with no API key at all:

- LinkedIn, RemoteOK, WeWorkRemotely, Arbeitnow
- Per-company ATS boards: Greenhouse, Lever, Ashby, Workable, Recruitee (for
  the companies you follow)

**LinkedIn and Indeed are slow and brittle.** Both are scraped from pages built
for people, so a fetch can take minutes and breaks when the site changes or
blocks bots. Indeed is off by default; turn it on in **Settings → Job Search**.

Adzuna and USAJobs need free API keys. Until you add them (in the wizard or
**Settings → Job Search**, each with a **Test** button) they show as "needs
key" in the fetch picker and are skipped.

The run chip at the top shows live progress — click it to see every running
and recently finished run in one panel. A first fetch typically returns a
few dozen jobs.

## 4. Score and shortlist

**Score** asks your AI server to rate each job against your profile and gives it
a **fit score** — 0-100, how well the job matches you. Hover any score chip in
the app for the same one-line explanation.

Then triage in the **Inbox**. The default **card view** shows one job at a time:

- **→** or **S** — shortlist it
- **←** or **X** — pass
- **Enter** — open the full posting
- **U** — undo
- **T** — shortlist and tailor in one step
- **L** — switch between the cards and the list

The **List view** button in the Inbox toolbar (or **L**) swaps the cards for the
list + detail pane; the same button switches back. It is a per-screen choice
that Jobsmith remembers — the Pipeline has its own, independent one.

Shortlisting is the signal Jobsmith acts on: shortlisted jobs are the ones that
get tailored documents.

If a run ends with "Scored 0 jobs (N failed)", the AI server is almost certainly
offline — check the banner.

## 5. Tailor

**Tailor** generates a resume and cover letter customized to a specific job.

- **Per job** — open a job and click **Tailor Resume**.
- **In batch** — the **Tailor** verb in the Activity run console tailors your
  shortlist. It only processes jobs with a **fit score of 50 or higher**. If it
  reports 0 tailored, either nothing is scored yet (run Score first) or nothing
  cleared 50 — use the per-job button to override.

**Honesty levels** control how far the AI may stray from your facts:
`honest` (reword only) → `tailored` (use the job's keywords, no fabrication) →
`embellished` (upgrade scope and impact) → `fabricated` (invent achievements).
The default is `honest`. Set the global default in **Settings → AI**, and
override it per edit in the AI Edit panel. Anything above `tailored` can produce
false statements — you are responsible for what you submit.

Generated documents land in the **Pipeline**, under **Ready to Review**. Review
them there; **AI Edit** lets you revise with natural-language instructions.

## 6. Install the browser extension

Applying uses the Jobsmith browser extension, which runs inside your normal
Chrome or Firefox.

Go to **Settings → Apply** and use **Get for Chrome** / **Get for
Firefox**. Chrome installs are unpacked (`chrome://extensions` → Developer mode
→ Load unpacked); Firefox has a signed build served straight from the app.

**Pairing is automatic.** The extension pairs itself with your local Jobsmith
the first time you launch Apply Assist. The extension token shown on that
settings page exists only as a fallback — paste it into the extension popup's
"Extension token" field only if automatic pairing fails.

## 7. Apply Assist

From any job with tailored documents, click **Apply Assist**. Jobsmith opens the
job's real ATS page in your browser and the extension injects a sidebar
containing your tailored resume, your cover letter, and your saved answers. It
autofills the standard fields for you.

You stay in the loop: check what was filled, fix anything the form did oddly,
and click **Submit** yourself. Jobsmith never submits on your behalf here.

Answers you type into a form are remembered in the **answer bank** and replayed
on the next application that asks the same question.

If Apply Assist fails to start, the usual cause is that the extension is not
installed yet — see step 6.

## 8. Mark Applied

After you submit, click **Mark Applied** — from the extension sidebar, the job
detail pane, or the Pipeline row. The job moves to **Applied** everywhere and
stops showing up in your review queue.

That is the full loop: **Fetch → Score → Shortlist → Tailor → Review → Apply
Assist → Mark Applied**. From here, the Pipeline board (Shortlisted → Tailoring
→ Ready to Review → Applied) is where you spend most of your time — drag a card
between columns to move a job along. Prefer lists? The **Table view** button in
the Pipeline toolbar (or **L**) swaps the board for the stage tabs, and back.

## Where to get help

- **Replay the product tour** — **Settings → App → Replay product tour** restarts the
  in-app walkthrough at any time.
- **Re-run the setup wizard** — **Settings → App → Re-run setup wizard**, safe on a
  configured install (it shows a diff first).
- **Bugs and questions** —
  [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/TheDevRo/Jobsmith/issues). Including what
  you were doing, what you expected, your OS, and which AI endpoint you have
  configured makes a fix much faster.
