# Jobsmith Browser Extension

Replaces the Playwright-based applicant-assist sidebar. Runs inside the
user's real Chrome or Firefox, uses their existing cookies/session, and talks
to the Jobsmith backend on `localhost:8888`.

## Status

**v0.3 — scan + autofill + highlight + resume drag-source.** The side panel
maps fields via the backend (profile / answer bank / local LLM), fills forms
using the native-setter trick (works on React/Vue/Angular), outlines each
field by outcome, and exposes the tailored resume + cover-letter DOCX as
draggable tiles that drop into native `<input type=file>` controls.

## Permissions

The extension asks for as little as it can up front:

| Permission | Why | When |
|---|---|---|
| `http://localhost/*`, `http://127.0.0.1/*` | talk to your Jobsmith backend | always (required) |
| `https://*.linkedin.com/*`, `https://*.indeed.com/*` | "Sync LinkedIn / Indeed" in the popup reads those sites' cookies so the backend's apply pipeline can act as you | always (required) |
| `cookies` | same as above — **only** LinkedIn and Indeed cookies are ever read, and they are POSTed **only** to your own `localhost` backend, never anywhere else | always (required) |
| `<all_urls>` | scan / autofill / attach on the long tail of ATS domains (Greenhouse, Lever, Workday, …) | **optional** — granted on demand |

Every other site is an *optional* host permission. The first time Jobsmith needs
to touch a new ATS domain, the toolbar icon shows a `!` badge; click it and
press **Grant access to this site** (the browsers only allow that prompt from a
user click, which is why the popup asks and not the background script). The
Apply Assist handoff and the docked panel resume automatically once granted.

## Build

```bash
./extension/scripts/build.sh
```

Produces:
- `extension/dist/chrome/`  — load unpacked at `chrome://extensions` (Developer Mode on → Load unpacked). Persists across restarts.
- `extension/dist/firefox/` — unsigned dir for quick iteration via `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox` → Load Temporary Add-on (cleared on restart).
- `extension/dist/*.zip`    — packaged artifacts the backend serves at `/api/extension/download/{chrome,firefox}`.

A signed `.xpi` in `extension/dist/firefox/web-ext-artifacts/` survives rebuilds
(build.sh stashes it) and is excluded from the zips.

In the app, Settings → Apply Assist → **Get for Chrome / Get for Firefox**
calls `POST /api/extension/save/{browser}` (loopback only), which copies the
extension into `~/Downloads` and reveals it — the desktop shell's webview can't
download files, so the backend writes to disk directly. Chrome gets the
unpacked folder; Firefox gets the signed `.xpi` when one exists, otherwise the
unpacked folder for a temporary install.

## Install (permanent)

**Chrome / Edge / Brave:** `chrome://extensions` → enable Developer Mode → **Load unpacked** → pick `extension/dist/chrome/`. Persists across restarts.

**Firefox (Mozilla-signed):** Firefox removes temporary add-ons on restart, so a permanent install must be signed. Build the signed `.xpi` once:

```bash
cd extension/dist/firefox
web-ext sign --channel=unlisted --api-key="$AMO_JWT_ISSUER" --api-secret="$AMO_JWT_SECRET"
```

(Generate `AMO_JWT_ISSUER`/`AMO_JWT_SECRET` at <https://addons.mozilla.org/developers/addon/api/key/>.) This drops a signed `.xpi` into `extension/dist/firefox/web-ext-artifacts/`. Then either:

- Run the backend and open Settings → Apply Assist → **Install for Firefox (signed)** (served from `/api/extension/firefox-xpi`); Firefox prompts to add it, **or**
- `about:addons` → gear ⚙️ → **Install Add-on From File…** → pick the `.xpi`.

> Re-signing requires a bumped `version` in `src/manifest.firefox.json` each time — AMO rejects duplicate versions.

## Configure

1. Start the backend (`./start_server.sh`). The token will be logged on startup
   and persisted at `data/extension_token.txt`.
2. Click the extension's toolbar icon → popup opens.
3. Paste the token into the **Extension token** field, click **Save**.
4. Click **Test connection** — should report "Connected. Token OK."

## Use

### Remote Docker / self-hosted instance

Set `JOBSMITH_EXTERNAL_URL` on the backend to its HTTPS origin, for example
`https://jobs.example.com` (no path). Keep dashboard authentication enabled and
configure your reverse proxy to preserve that Host header. Download the Chrome
or Firefox ZIP from that instance's `/api/extension/download/{chrome,firefox}`
endpoint and load it as described above. Older signed Firefox builds do not
include this remote support; use the current ZIP until a new build is signed.

In the extension popup, set **Backend URL** to that same HTTPS origin and click
**Save**. Grant access when the browser asks; only that backend host is requested.
Then click **Apply Assist** from a tailored job in the authenticated dashboard,
using the same browser. The extension reads the launch page's temporary setup
token and pairs automatically, so you do not need to expose the loopback-only
token endpoint or copy a token manually. A saved token is reused only at its
exact origin; changing host, scheme, or port pairs using the new setup token.
Other websites cannot initiate remote pairing. Local desktop pairing continues
to work without this configuration.

### Application form

- Click the toolbar icon → **Open panel** (Chrome) or open the sidebar (Firefox).
- Navigate to a job application page.
- Enter the **Job ID** (from the Jobsmith UI) and click **Load**. This
  pulls the tailored resume + cover-letter DOCX as draggable tiles, and lets
  the LLM see the job description when mapping fields.
- Click **Scan** → backend maps every visible field via profile / answer bank
  / local LLM.
- Click **Autofill** → fields are filled in your real browser. Outlines show
  the outcome (green=filled, yellow=low confidence, gray=skipped,
  red=failed/missing).
- **Click any field card** in the panel to copy its value to the clipboard
  (handy for fields the autofill can't reach) — a toast confirms the copy.
- Toggle **Auto-scan** off to stop the panel scanning/polling in the
  background; it then acts only when you click Scan/Autofill.
- Drag the **Resume** or **Cover Letter** tile onto the ATS's file input.
