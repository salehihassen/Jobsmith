Be realistic. Score based on what the candidate has actually done, not aspirational fit.

OUTPUT FORMAT RULES (the document parser requires these exactly):
- Output EXACTLY these section headers in ALL CAPS on their own line, with nothing else on that line:
  SUMMARY
  SKILLS
  EXPERIENCE
  EDUCATION
  CERTIFICATIONS
- Do NOT use any markdown (no **, no ##, no ```, no * bullets). Use plain dashes (-) for bullet points.
- Do NOT include the candidate's name or contact info — that is added separately.
- Target 500-700 words total. Prioritize relevance over length.
- For each experience entry, output EXACTLY in this format on separate lines:
  Title: [exact title from profile]
  Company: [exact company from profile]
  Dates: [exact dates from profile]
  - [bullet point]

EXAMPLE FORMAT:
SUMMARY
Two to three sentences summarizing the candidate for this specific role.

SKILLS
Python, AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD

EXPERIENCE
Title: Senior Software Engineer
Company: Acme Corp
Dates: Jan 2022 - Present
- Led migration of monolithic app to microservices, reducing deploy time by 40%
- Built REST APIs serving 10M requests/day using FastAPI and PostgreSQL
- Mentored 4 engineers and established code review standards adopted team-wide

EDUCATION
Degree: B.S. Computer Science
School: State University
Year: 2019

CERTIFICATIONS
- AWS Solutions Architect Associate

Instructions:
1. Reorder and prioritize the candidate's existing skills to match the job description
2. For each of the candidate's real experience entries, rewrite bullets to emphasize relevance to THIS role. Output EXACTLY 3 bullets per entry — no more, no less.
3. Naturally incorporate keywords from the job description into descriptions of the candidate's real experience
4. Use strong action verbs and quantify achievements where possible
5. You may omit less relevant roles, but NEVER add roles that aren't in the candidate's profile
6. Follow the format EXACTLY — the parser depends on "Title:", "Company:", "Dates:" prefixes on their own lines
7. Copy job titles, company names, and dates VERBATIM from the candidate profile — do NOT alter, merge, or round them
8. If the candidate held multiple roles at the same company, keep them as SEPARATE entries with their own dates

STRICT RULES:
1. You must only use information explicitly stated in the candidate profile provided. If the answer to a field cannot be found in the profile, return an empty string and set confidence to 0.0. Do not infer, estimate, or generate any fact not present verbatim in the profile — this includes but is not limited to: employers, job titles, dates, credentials, certifications, skills, project names, and personal details.
2. If a field has an "options" list, the value MUST be copied character-for-character from that list — pick the option that best matches the profile fact (set action="select"). Never invent an option. If no option fits, pick the "Prefer not to answer"/"Decline" style option when one exists, else skip.
3. For EEO/demographic fields (gender, race, veteran, disability): use the profile value if set; otherwise output "Prefer not to answer" (or the closest decline-style option).
4. For checkbox fields: value must be "Yes" or "No" with action="check".
5. For open-ended text fields: use the answer_bank snippet if relevant, otherwise generate a concise professional answer (≤80 words) based only on profile facts.
6. Use the "extra_context" and "autocomplete" hints to understand ambiguous labels (e.g. a "Yes" label whose extra_context holds the real question).
7. For date fields, match the format shown in the placeholder; default to MM/DD/YYYY.
8. If you cannot determine a value confidently, set action="skip" and value="".
9. Output only the JSON array. Do not add any text, explanation, or commentary after the closing bracket.

OUTPUT SCHEMA — a JSON array where every element has exactly these keys:
[
  {
    "field_id": "<same id as input>",
    "value": "<string value to fill, or empty string to skip>",
    "action": "fill" | "select" | "check" | "upload" | "skip",
