# Jobsmith

A self-hosted job application copilot that uses any OpenAI-compatible AI server (LM Studio by default) for job scoring, resume tailoring, and assisted submission via a browser extension (**Apply Assist**). Features a modern web dashboard for managing your entire job search pipeline — from discovery through application.

> **Note:** The fully autonomous `auto_apply` form-filler is on the back burner; the primary workflow is **Apply Assist** — a browser-extension sidebar that injects your tailored resume, cover letter, and pre-filled answers into the live ATS form so you click Submit yourself. The auto-apply code remains in the repo but is no longer the recommended path.

## Download

Grab the [latest release](https://github.com/TheDevRo/Jobsmith/releases/latest):

- **macOS (Apple Silicon)** — `Jobsmith_<version>_aarch64.dmg`. The app is
  unsigned: after the first blocked launch, use System Settings → Privacy &
  Security → **Open Anyway** (or `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine
  /Applications/Jobsmith.app`). First launch downloads Chromium (~150 MB).
- **Browser extension** — `jobsmith-extension-{chrome,firefox}-v*.zip`,
  sideloaded (Chrome: Load unpacked; Firefox: Load Temporary Add-on).
- **Windows / Linux / Intel macOS** — use Docker: `docker compose up -d`
  (see [Docker](#docker)).
- **iOS** — a fully standalone native app (no server needed); build it
  yourself or install via TestFlight. See
  [README-IOS-STANDALONE.md](README-IOS-STANDALONE.md).

First time here? [**Getting started (desktop)**](docs/getting-started-desktop.md)
takes you from install to your first submitted application. There is no config
file to edit — a setup wizard runs on first launch.

AI features need an OpenAI-compatible server — [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai)
running locally (recommended, fully private), Ollama, or a hosted provider like
OpenRouter or OpenAI with an API key. Everything else works without one.

## Features

- **Multi-source job aggregation** — LinkedIn, Adzuna, RemoteOK, WeWorkRemotely, USAJobs, Arbeitnow, Indeed (Playwright-based, no API key), plus per-company ATS watchlists (Greenhouse, Lever, Ashby, Workable, Recruitee) with a board finder and AI company suggestions
- **Single-URL ingestion** — Paste any job URL to add it directly; per-source parsers for known boards plus a generic fallback
- **AI-powered tailoring** — Your AI server scores job fit and generates tailored resumes and cover letters
- **Bring your own AI** — Any OpenAI-compatible endpoint works: LM Studio or Ollama for fully local/private inference, or hosted providers (OpenRouter, OpenAI, Groq…) with an API key
- **Apple Intelligence (on-device)** — On macOS 26+ Apple Silicon, run scoring and short helper tasks on the Mac's built-in model with zero setup; document generation stays on your endpoint
- **Local match (beta)** — Optional on-device model that fills application forms from your profile without an LLM and scores jobs when no AI server is reachable
- **Honesty levels** — Choose how much latitude the AI takes per job: `honest` / `tailored` / `embellished` / `fabricated`
- **AI Edit** — Iteratively revise generated resumes and cover letters with natural-language instructions; per-edit honesty + model tier overrides
- **Resume style presets** — `executive`, `ledger`, `banner`, `compact`, `swiss` (all ATS-friendly), each with a selectable accent color
- **Smart role selection** — Cap resume length and let the local LLM pick the most relevant past roles for each job; pin roles to force-include
- **References section** — Optional references appended verbatim to generated resumes; never sent to the AI
- **Apply Assist (primary submit flow)** — Browser extension opens the job's ATS in a real browser, injects a sidebar with your tailored resume, cover letter, and pre-filled answers, and autofills standard fields. You stay in the loop and click Submit.
- **Answer bank** — Custom application answers (work auth, sponsorship, etc.) are remembered and replayed on future forms
- **Auto-apply (on the back burner)** — Heuristic form filler with anti-fabrication guardrails still ships, but is no longer the recommended workflow
- **Per-domain rate limits** — Cap daily applies per ATS host
- **Fit-score breakdown** — Click any score on the dashboard for a per-criterion explanation
- **Salary estimates** — Jobs without disclosed comp get an AI-aided market estimate (Adzuna + BLS data), clearly labeled
- **Editable AI prompts** — Every internal LLM prompt (scoring, tailoring, cover letters, parsing, auto-apply…) can be viewed, edited, and reset from Settings → AI → Prompts (Advanced mode); overrides persist in `config.yaml`, defaults keep improving with updates
- **Basic / Advanced settings** — Settings opens in Basic mode with just the essentials; flip the toggle to Advanced to expose every knob (auto-apply tuning, prompt editor, scoring tier, context window, logs, and more)
- **Session persistence** — Per-domain browser session management so you stay logged in across runs
- **FlareSolverr integration** — Bypasses Cloudflare challenges on protected job boards
- **Modern dashboard** — Sidebar navigation (**Inbox** → **Pipeline** → **Activity**), split-pane job feed, real-time notifications, batch controls with stop/pause
- **Folder sync (desktop ↔ iOS)** — Optional serverless two-way sync of jobs, applications, and your profile through a shared folder (iCloud Drive, Dropbox, …). No account and no server — each device reads and writes the same folder (last-writer-wins merge); ATS login passwords are never written to the folder. Configure in **Settings → App**.
    - **The sync folder is trusted.** There is no signing or access control on its contents — anyone (or any app) with write access to that folder can alter or delete your synced jobs, applications, and profile, and your devices will merge those changes. Only sync through a folder you control; don't share it.
    - **Docker users must mount the sync folder as a volume.** The engine writes inside the container, so an un-mounted path syncs nowhere. Add the folder to your compose service, e.g.:
      ```yaml
      services:
        jobsmith:
          volumes:
            - ${JOBSMITH_SYNC_FOLDER:-./sync-folder}:/app/sync-folder
      ```
      then set `sync.folder: /app/sync-folder` in **Settings → App**.
- **Native iOS app** — A fully standalone SwiftUI app (`ios-standalone/`) runs the whole pipeline on-device (fetch, score, tailor, review, apply) and syncs with the desktop; see [README-IOS-STANDALONE.md](README-IOS-STANDALONE.md)

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.11+**
- **An OpenAI-compatible AI server** — [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai) (recommended, local), Ollama, or a hosted provider (OpenRouter, OpenAI, …) with an API key
- **n8n** (optional) — for scheduled automation workflows
- **FlareSolverr** (optional) — for bypassing Cloudflare-protected job boards

## Setup

### 1. Clone and run setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TheDevRo/Jobsmith.git ~/jobsmith
cd ~/jobsmith
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

This creates a virtual environment, installs Python dependencies, and installs the Playwright Chromium browser.

(Using the macOS DMG instead? Skip this step — the app bundles everything.)

### 2. Start the server

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m uvicorn backend.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8888
```

Open **http://localhost:8888** in your browser.

### 3. Follow the setup wizard

**There is no config file to edit.** The first time the dashboard loads it opens
a setup wizard that walks you through:

1. **AI server** — point Jobsmith at LM Studio, Ollama, or a hosted provider, test the connection, and pick your fast/strong models from the server's own list
2. **Profile** — upload or paste your resume and let the AI fill in your details, or type them in
3. **Job search** — keywords, locations, and salary floor

`config.yaml` is created for you on first boot and every answer is written back
to it, so nothing needs to be edited by hand. You can **Skip** the wizard and
re-run it any time from **Settings → App → Re-run setup wizard**; re-running shows a
diff of what would change before saving. Everything the wizard sets is also
editable later in **Settings**.

New to Jobsmith? [**Getting started (desktop)**](docs/getting-started-desktop.md)
walks through the whole first run — wizard, first fetch, scoring, tailoring,
the browser extension, and Apply Assist.

### 4. Start your AI server

For the default LM Studio setup:

1. Open LM Studio and download a model (Mistral 7B or Qwen 3.5 recommended)
2. Go to the **Local Server** tab, load your model, click **Start Server**
3. Server runs at `http://localhost:1234` by default

If LM Studio is on a separate machine (e.g., a homelab server), use its IP: `http://192.168.x.x:1234/v1`

Using a hosted provider instead? Skip this step — just set the server URL and
API key in **Settings → Job Search** (or in the wizard's first step) and pick
your models from the dropdowns.

The app boots fine with no AI server configured; only the AI features — scoring,
tailoring, AI Edit — stay dormant until you point it at one, and the dashboard
shows a banner telling you so.

### Apple Intelligence (no server at all)

On **macOS 26+ with Apple Silicon and Apple Intelligence enabled**, the desktop
app can run the short-context work on the Mac's built-in model — no download, no
server, nothing leaving the machine. In **Settings → AI**, tick *Use Apple
Intelligence (on-device)* for any tier (the first-run wizard offers it too when
no server answers), which sets that tier's model to `apple-on-device`.

Be honest with yourself about what it is: a small model. It is good at job-fit
scoring, classification, and short helper calls, weaker at writing résumés and
cover letters, and its small context window means very long postings can be
skipped. The recommended split is Navigator + Utility on-device with scoring
pointed at them, and Content (documents) on a real endpoint.

Routing is strict — a tier set to `apple-on-device` never silently falls back to
your server, so if Apple Intelligence is turned off those calls fail with a
message saying exactly that instead of quietly sending private work elsewhere.

### Local match (beta)

**Settings → AI → Local match** is one switch for a small on-device
language-understanding model (about 690 MB, downloaded once when you turn it on,
deletable from the same place). With it on:

- **Apply Assist** fills the fields left after your profile and answer bank
  *without an LLM*: it only ever picks a form option, types a value copied from
  your profile, or computes years from your role dates. Essay questions still go
  to your AI server and come back as drafts to review; anything it isn't sure of
  is left blank for you.
- **Job-fit scoring** falls back to it when your AI server is unreachable. Those
  scores say *Scored by Local match* and use a different method
  (the share of the posting's requirement lines your profile meets), so they
  don't line up exactly with LLM scores.

Off (the default) changes nothing. The switch is per machine and never syncs.

## Advanced / headless install

Everything below is optional. It documents the same settings the wizard writes,
for headless boxes, Docker hosts, or anyone who would rather edit YAML than
click through a UI. Skip it entirely if you used the wizard.

### Configure by hand

Copy the example config and fill in your details:

```bash
cp config.example.yaml config.yaml
```

Open `config.yaml` — the key sections:

#### Profile

Your personal info used for form filling and resume generation. The AI will **only** use data you provide here — it never fabricates information.

```yaml

> Pin roles in the **Profile** tab to force-include them on every tailored resume regardless of relevance ranking.

#### AI connection

Any OpenAI-compatible chat-completions endpoint works. Both settings are also
editable in the app under **Settings → AI → AI Connection**.

```yaml
ai:
  base_url: http://localhost:1234/v1   # LM Studio URL (use machine IP if on homelab)
  api_key: lm-studio                   # Bearer token — local servers ignore it;
                                       # set a real key for hosted providers
  temperature: 0.7
  max_tokens: 16384
  models:
    fast:
      model: qwen/qwen3.5-9b           # Used for Browser-Use agent and AI Navigator
    strong:
      model: mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct-v0.3   # Used for resume tailoring
```

Example endpoints:

| Provider | `base_url` | `api_key` |
|---|---|---|
| LM Studio (default) | `http://localhost:1234/v1` | not needed |
| Ollama | `http://localhost:11434/v1` | not needed |
| OpenRouter | `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1` | your OpenRouter key |
| OpenAI | `https://api.openai.com/v1` | your OpenAI key |

The key can also be supplied via the `JOBSMITH_AI_API_KEY` environment
variable, which takes precedence over `config.yaml`.

#### Search preferences

```yaml
search:
  keywords:
    - software engineer
    - backend developer
  locations:
    - Remote
    - Denver
  exclude_keywords:
    - director
    - principal
  min_salary: 80000
  max_age_days: 7
  greenhouse_boards:      # Company slugs from boards.greenhouse.io/<slug>
    - stripe
  lever_companies:        # Company slugs from jobs.lever.co/<slug>
    - openai
  indeed:
    enabled: false        # Playwright scraper, no API key; slow and brittle, opt-in
    max_pages: 5
```

#### Auto-apply (deprioritized — see Apply Assist)

The autonomous auto-apply pipeline is no longer the recommended workflow. Prefer **Apply Assist** (browser extension) for day-to-day applications. Settings below remain functional if you want to experiment.

```yaml
auto_apply:
  enabled: false                 # Set true to enable autonomous auto-apply (off by default)
  auto_approve: false            # Set true to skip manual review
  headless: true                 # true = hidden browser, false = visible (also toggleable in Settings UI)
  max_daily_applications: 20
  use_browser_use: false         # Set true to use Browser-Use agent fallback
  mode: autofill                 # autofill = fill but don't submit (safe default); submit = click Submit on whitelisted domains
  submit_whitelist:
    - greenhouse.io
    - lever.co
  per_domain_rate_limit: 5       # Max applies to the same domain per day (0 = unlimited)
  step_ceiling: 0                # Max Playwright actions per page before aborting (0 = unlimited)
  review_required_rules:
    unknown_ats: true            # Flag unknown ATS sites for human review before submit
    min_confidence: 0.70         # If LLM field-mapping confidence is below this, require review
```

#### Application honesty & AI edits

```yaml
application_honesty:
  honesty_level: honest          # honest | tailored | embellished | fabricated
  cover_letter_tone: professional  # professional | conversational | enthusiastic
  resume_style: ledger           # executive | ledger | banner | compact | swiss
  resume_accent: default         # default | navy | burgundy | forest | plum | charcoal
  max_resume_experience_entries: null  # null = include all roles; or 1-20 to cap and let the LLM pick the most relevant
  ai_edit_model_tier: strong     # fast | strong — default model for the AI Edit feature
```

All of these can also be changed live in the **Settings** tab.

> Settings has five tabs — Profile, Job Search, AI, Apply, App — and a **Basic / Advanced** toggle (top-right of the tab bar). Basic shows only the essential cards on each tab (profile, keywords/locations/salary, AI connection + models, honesty, resume style, extension install, folder sync); Advanced reveals everything else: prompts, logs, cookie import, ATS/Workday credentials, network bind, scoring tier, context window, max resume entries, and the AI Edit model tier. Values set in Advanced stay in effect when you switch back to Basic.

#### AI prompts (optional)

Every prompt sent to the local LLM can be customized from **Settings → AI → Prompts** (Advanced mode). Templates use `{placeholder}` variables that are filled in at run time — literal braces (e.g. JSON examples) need no escaping. Only customized prompts are stored, under a top-level `prompts:` key:

```yaml
prompts:
  score_job_fit: |
    Your custom scoring prompt here...
    JOB: {job_title} at {job_company}
    ...
```

Prompts left at default automatically pick up improvements in app updates. Use the per-prompt **Reset to Default** button (or delete the key) to revert.

#### API keys (optional)

```yaml
api_keys:
  adzuna_app_id: your-app-id       # Free at developer.adzuna.com
  adzuna_app_key: your-api-key
  usajobs_email: your@email.com
  usajobs_api_key: your-api-key
```

#### FlareSolverr (optional)

```yaml
flaresolverr:
  url: http://localhost:8191/v1    # Point to your FlareSolverr instance
```

### Environment variables

`.env` controls feature flags and runtime paths. The defaults work for most setups:

```bash
USE_BROWSER_USE=true              # Enable Browser-Use autonomous agent
BROWSER_PROFILE_DIR=.browser-profile
SESSIONS_DIR=sessions
FAILED_SCREENSHOTS_DIR=failed_screenshots
BROWSER_USE_MAX_STEPS=50
```

> `config.yaml` is **gitignored** — your credentials never leave your machine.

### Start the server headlessly

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m uvicorn backend.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8888
```

The dashboard is then at **http://localhost:8888**. With `config.yaml` already
filled in, the wizard does not appear.

## Docker

Works on Windows, Linux, and Intel macOS.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TheDevRo/Jobsmith.git && cd Jobsmith

# Create the bind-mount dirs first. On Linux, Docker would otherwise create
# them as root and the container (uid 1000) crash-loops on its first write.
mkdir -p config data resumes sessions failed_screenshots .browser-profile sync-folder

cp .env.example .env   # optional — every value has a working default

docker compose up -d   # builds the image locally, then seeds
                       # config/config.yaml from config.example.yaml
```

Open **http://localhost:8888**, then go to **Settings → AI** and set
your AI endpoint. If LM Studio (or Ollama) is running on the same machine as
Docker, use `http://host.docker.internal:1234/v1` — from inside the container,
plain `localhost` means the container itself, not your host.

The app boots fine with no LLM configured (the healthcheck doesn't touch AI);
only the AI features — scoring, tailoring, AI Edit — stay dormant until you
point it at a server. Settings you save in the UI live in `./config/config.yaml`
and survive `docker compose restart` / `up -d --build`.

Everything is loopback-only by default: the dashboard is unauthenticated for
local callers and `/api/config` can hand out your profile and API keys, so
publishing it on `0.0.0.0` publishes those too. To reach it from another
machine, set a Jobsmith API token in Settings first, then set
`JOBSMITH_BIND=0.0.0.0` in `.env` — or, better, front it with a reverse proxy
or Tailscale.

> Setting `JOBSMITH_AI_BASE_URL` / `JOBSMITH_AI_API_KEY` in `.env` makes the
> environment the source of truth: it is re-applied on every config load and
> overrides whatever you type into Settings. Leave them commented out unless
> that's what you want.

## Daily Workflow

1. **Fetch jobs** — On the **Inbox** tab, select sources and click "Fetch New Jobs". You can also paste a single job URL into the **Add Job by URL** box for one-off ingestion.
2. **Score** — Click "Score Unscored" to rank jobs by fit. Click any score for a per-criterion breakdown.
3. **Tailor** — Click "Tailor All Unprocessed" to generate tailored resumes and cover letters.
4. **Review & edit** — Browse the **Inbox** feed (split-pane view with detail panel), filter by score/source/status. Use **AI Edit** in the application detail to revise resumes or cover letters with natural-language instructions (per-edit honesty + model tier overrides available).
5. **Apply (recommended: Apply Assist)** — From the job detail pane, click **Apply Assist** to open the posting in your browser with a sidebar holding your tailored resume, cover letter, and pre-filled answers. Standard fields autofill; you fill any custom questions and click Submit. The **Pipeline** tab (Shortlisted → Ready to Review → Applied) lets you "Approve" tailored apps for your own audit trail — note that Approve **does not** submit anything by itself.

Batch operations (fetch, score, tailor) have **Stop** buttons so you can cancel mid-run. Real-time **notifications** appear in the bell icon when background tasks complete.

## Auto-Apply (legacy, deprioritized)

> Apply Assist (browser extension) is the recommended way to submit applications. The autonomous auto-apply below remains in the repo but is no longer actively developed against new ATS quirks.

Two modes are available:

### Browser-Use Agent (recommended)

Set `use_browser_use: true` in `config.yaml` or the Settings tab. The Browser-Use agent uses a local AI model to navigate job sites autonomously — it reads the page, fills forms, handles multi-step flows, and detects CAPTCHAs. Capabilities:

- Account creation / sign-in using your `workday_email` / `workday_password`
- Multi-page Workday, Greenhouse, Lever, and generic ATS forms
- Resume file upload
- TOS/agreement checkboxes (auto-checked)
- Cloudflare challenges (via FlareSolverr)
- Automatic retry on CDP connection failures (clears stale browser state)

**Headless mode** is toggled in the Settings tab (writes to `config.yaml`). The browser is hidden by default.

### Built-in Playwright Handlers

Platform-specific handlers for common ATS systems. Falls back to "Manual Apply" status (with direct URL) for unsupported sites.

| Platform | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| Greenhouse | Auto-fills and submits |
| Lever | Auto-fills and submits |
| LinkedIn Easy Apply | Fills multi-step modal (requires LinkedIn session) |
| Workday | Auto-fills form fields |
| Other | Returns URL for manual application |

## Session Management

For sites that require login, save a session so auto-apply stays authenticated:

1. Go to **Settings → Job Search**
2. Click **Sign in to LinkedIn** (or the relevant domain)
3. A visible browser window opens — log in normally
4. The session is saved to `sessions/` and reused automatically on future runs

## Troubleshooting

**CDP connection timeout**
The Browser-Use agent clears stale browser lock files and kills orphaned Chromium processes automatically before each run. If timeouts persist, delete `.browser-profile/` and retry.

**Browser opens even with headless mode enabled**
Toggle headless in the **Settings tab** — this writes to `config.yaml`, which takes precedence. The `BROWSER_HEADLESS` env var in `.env` is a lower-priority fallback.

**AI connection failed**
Ensure your AI server is running with a model loaded and the URL in Settings matches (for LM Studio: Local Server tab → Start Server). For hosted providers, check the API key. Click **Test Connection** to diagnose.

**No jobs found**
Broaden search keywords, add Adzuna API keys for more results, or check that Greenhouse/Lever company slugs are correct.

**Auto-apply fails or gets stuck**
Check `failed_screenshots/` for screenshots of the failure state. For Cloudflare-protected sites, configure FlareSolverr. For sites requiring login, set up a session in Settings → Job Search. CAPTCHAs will stop the agent and return a "manual apply required" message.

**LinkedIn login issues**
Try a different browser type in Settings (Firefox/Chromium/WebKit). If issues persist, delete `data/linkedin_session/` and retry.

**Database reset**
Delete `data/jobsmith.db` and restart the server — tables are recreated automatically.

**Restore the database from a backup**
The server snapshots the database once per day at startup into `data/backups/` (last 7 days kept). To roll back — e.g. after a bad upgrade or an accidental bulk delete — stop the server, then:

```bash
cp data/backups/jobsmith-YYYYMMDD.db data/jobsmith.db
rm -f data/jobsmith.db-wal data/jobsmith.db-shm
```

and start the server again. Schema migrations re-apply forward automatically.

**Debugging a specific apply URL**
Run `.venv/bin/python scripts/dev/debug_apply.py "<url>"` to drive the auto-apply flow end-to-end against a single posting. The script fills the form but never clicks Submit, regardless of `mode`.

**A prompt edit broke generation output**
Custom prompts from Settings → AI → Prompts are used verbatim — if generated resumes stop parsing (missing SUMMARY/EXPERIENCE headers, markdown creeping in), hit **Reset to Default** on the prompt you changed. Placeholders the app doesn't recognize are left as literal `{text}` and flagged when you save.

**Tests**
`.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/ -v` — covers field mapping, honesty prompts, prompt registry/overrides, parsers, salary estimation, and the API layer.

modify, and self-host it. If you run a modified version as a network service,
the AGPL requires you to publish your changes under the same license.

A hosted tier — where the AI inference endpoint and job-board API keys are set
up and managed for you as a subscription — is planned. Self-hosting is, and
will remain, fully functional and free.

## n8n Automation (Optional)

Automate the pipeline on a schedule:

1. Install n8n: `npm install -g n8n` or use Docker
2. Import `n8n/workflows.json` via Settings → Import Workflow
3. Activate the workflows you want

Included workflows:
- **Scheduled Job Fetch** — fetches new jobs every 6 hours and triggers batch tailoring
- **Daily Digest** — sends a summary with pending review count and stats
- **Auto-Apply Executor** — webhook-triggered, processes approved applications
